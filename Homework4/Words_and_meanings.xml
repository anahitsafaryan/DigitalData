           <div type="chapter" n="1.general"><p n="1"> always a greater or less degree of 
              vagueness. The <term ref="#T2">meaning</term>
            is an area, 
            like a target : it may have a bull's eye,
            but the outlying parts of the target are still more or less within the 
            meaning, in a gradually diminishing degree as we travel further from the 
            bull's eye. As language grows more precise, there is less and less of the 
            target outside the bull's eye, and the bull's eye itself grows smaller and 
            smaller; but the bull's eye never shrinks to a point, and there is always a 
            doubtful region, however small, surrounding it.On the understanding 
            of <term ref="#T1">words</term> 
            a very admirable little book 
            is <bibl xml:id="Ribot_99"><name xml:id="P1">Ribot</name>'s Evolution of 
               General Ideas, Open Court 
            Co., 1899.</bibl> <name ref="#P1">Ribot</name>
              says (p. 131): <quote source="#Ribot_99">"We 
               learn to understand a concept as we learn to 
            walk, dance, fence or play a musical instrument: it is a habit, i.e. an organized 
            memory. General terms cover an organized, latent knowledge which is the hidden 
            capital without which we should be in a state of bankruptcy, manipulating false 
            money or paper of no value. General ideas are habits in the intellectual order."</quote>
         </p>   
            
            <p n="2">A <term ref="#T1">word</term> is used "correctly" when the average hearer will be affected by it in the 
            way intended. This is a psychological, not a literary, of "correctness." The literary 
            definition would substitute, for the average hearer, a person of high education living 
            a long time ago; the purpose of this definition is to make it difficult to speak or write 
            correctly.</p>
            
            
            <p n="3">The relation of a <term ref="#T1">word</term> to its <term ref="#T2">meaning</term> is of the nature of a causal law governing 
            our use of the <term ref="#T1">word</term> and our actions when we hear it used. There is no more reason 
            why a person who uses a <term ref="#T1">word</term> correctly should be able to tell what it means than 
            there is why a planet which is moving correctly should know <name xml:id="P2">Kepler</name>'s laws.</p>

           <div type="chapter" n="2.suggestion"> <p n="4">To illustrate what is meant by <q>"understanding"</q> <term ref="#T1">words</term> and sentences, let us take instances 
            of various situations.</p></div>
            
            
         <div type="chapter" n="3.situations"><p n="5"> Suppose <rs xml:id='One' type="person">you</rs> 
            are walking in <address><name type="city">London</name></address> with 
            an absent-minded <rs xml:id="Friend" type="person">friend</rs>, and while crossing a street 
            you say, <said who="One">"Look out, there's a motor coming."</said> 
            <rs ref="#Friend">He</rs> will glance round and jump aside without the 
            need of any <q>" mental "</q> intermediary. There need be no <q>"ideas,"</q> but 
            only a stiffening of the 
            muscles, followed quickly by action. <rs ref="#Friend">He</rs> <q>"understands"</q> 
            the <term ref="#T1">words</term>, because 
            <rs ref="#Friend">he</rs> does the right 
            thing. Such <q>"understanding "</q> may be taken to belong to the nerves and brain, 
            being habits 
            which they have acquired while the language was being learnt. Thus understanding in this 
            sense may be reduced to mere physiological causal laws.</p>
            
            
           <p n="6"> If <rs ref="#One">you</rs> say the same thing to a

              <q who="#Frenchman">"<foreign>Que dit-il ? Ah, oui, une automobile !</foreign>" </q>
            After this, the rest follows as with the Englishman. <name xml:id="P3">Watson</name> would contend that the inner speech 
            must be incipiently pronounced; we should argue that it might be merely imaged. But this point 
            is not important in the present connection. </p>

            other words <rs ref="#One">you</rs> are using, 
              <rs ref="#One">you</rs> produce a feeling of anxiety and doubt: 
              <rs ref="#One">you</rs> will have to point 
            and say, <q who="#One">"There, that's a motor."</q> After that the 
              <rs ref="#Child">child</rs> will roughly understand the 
              word <q>"motor," </q>
            though <rs ref="#Child">he</rs> may include trains
              and steam-rollers If this is the first time the
              <rs ref="#Child">child</rs> has heard the 
            word "motor," 
              <rs ref="#Child">he</rs> may for a 
              long time continue to recall this scene when
